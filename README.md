# euler-2D-kfvs
Euler equations unstructured solver using kinetic flux vector splitting (KFVS) scheme.

Some features:
- Finite volume method.
- Unstructured quadrilateral meshes.
- Kinetic flux vector splitting (KFVS) scheme. 
- Written in Modern Fortran (Fortran 95 + some Fortran 2003). No real OOP has been implemented yet.
- Use core code of gmsh-to-vtk-and-tecplot as a mesh reader.

euler-2D-kfvs is inspired by the structured finite volume solver of Prof. Luc Mieussens. Link of the original structured solver of Prof. Luc Mieussens:
